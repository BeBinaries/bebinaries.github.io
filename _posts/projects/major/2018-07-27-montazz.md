<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

Apache Kafka is a messaging system that is designed to be fast, scalable, and durable. It is an open-source stream processing platform. In Big Data, an enormous volume of data is used and the problem is storage of such large volume of data.To overcome this, we need a messaging system. That is why we need Kafka. The functionalities that it provides are well-suited for our requirements, and thus we use Kafka for:

<li>Building real-time streaming data pipelines that can get data between systems and applications.</li>

<li>Building real-time streaming applications to react to the stream of data.</li>

Apache Kafka follows publish-subscribe messaging system. In a publish-subscribe system, messages are persisted in a topic. Message producers are called publishers and message consumers are called subscribers. Consumers can subscribe to one or more topic and consume all the messages in that topic.

MONTAZ is aimed to provide an online platform for live streaming and merging of videos streamed via webcam of laptops or camera of mobile phones. The resultant montage would be available online as well as, would be downloadable. Montage is basically a technique in film editing in which short shots are edited into a sequence to condense space, time and information.


<h4>Current Features of MONTAZ :</h4>
<li>User login</li>
<li>Live streaming using web camera (laptop)</li>
<li>Merging of videos from multiple sources</li>
<li>Displaying of online portal</li>


The product serves as an aid for all those, who struggle in their daily life for lacing bits of their valuable memories into one. For instance, the reporters have to edit the videos each captured from different angles so as to make it one before publishing in order to ensure presence of each and every bit of instance captured is telecast. Also, videos captured during any party or even conferences through different cameras have to be merged together, which takes a lot of precious time of people involved in work.  



<h2>ANALYSIS OF PROBLEM</h2>
The Basic requirement of our capstone project was to make use of synchronous apache kafka for inter service communication. We had to explicitly make use of synchronous mode of kafka, which does not have many use cases. Since a synchronous message communication doesnâ€™t allows a producer to send any further data until it receives a acknowledgement back from consumer. This technique is not an efficient one for high volume message transfer. So, we came up this idea of montage where we can actually limit a user from pushing data onto kafka server until and unless its his/her turn to do so. Doing this puts one user at a constant wait which basically what is demanded in a synchronous kafka communication.
