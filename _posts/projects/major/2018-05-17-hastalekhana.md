<h2>Project Description</h2>
Hastalekhana is a handwriting based Android application which is focused toward converting any Kind of handwritten may it be sentence/geometry /symbol etc. into a searchable text which could be placed anywhere while giving input to a system. Its part of a research field Human Computer Interface (HCI) where we use different methods to interact with a computer. In this project we are focused toward reestablishment of the trend of writing with hand rather than punching keys on a keyboard.

<h2>Motivation</h2>
As the technology is growing, people are getting used to scenarios where they have to sit in front of a pc and punch keys on the keyboard. Somewhere down the line, we are losing the vigor of writing things with our own hand, in our own handwriting. Since this thing was only possible using pen to write on a paper.
In this digital world, many people would like to have amenity to write things with hand and there we had our first hit to build a system through which we could scribble something in our handwriting and can have its digital footprint.
Next, its not just about the amenity. There are thousands of things that are way easier to write in our own handwriting then to digitally write using mouse and keyboard. One of those things are having to write mathematical or geometrical symbols in a document using mouse and keyboard. There we found a need of such system.
Finally, there is a scenario when a person wants to put his own signature on a pdf or a word document. In that case, usually a person has to take a printout of the document, sign and scan the document again. To overcome that hustle we proposed a system which can eliminate all the scanning and printing thing and give the user a direct access to his document to paste his/her own signature on to the document.

<h2>Survey Explanation</h2>
We performed a casual survey on around 150 people and observed their opinions and thinking about one such system. 	The key points of that survey are given below:
<li>25% of people prefer writing their notes directly on a device and surprisingly 60.2% were ok with both pen and paper and devices.</li>
<li>46.3% of people found the idea of converting handwriting into digital font, both excellent and good.</li>
<li>57.9% people found one such system a useful tool for people having bad handwriting.</li>
<li>60.3% people find it difficult to add mathematical and geometrical symbols to a digital or text document.</li>
<li>53.7% people were in the favor of adding their signature directly on to a text document.</li>
Finally we got a great response of 57% people stating that our app idea will be a great success. Few people suggested us some improvements that can be done.

<h2>Final working system</h2>
The final working system has all the issues and bugs fixed. We have optimized our code which has made the android application just of 20 MBs. The system end software is working exactly as it was expected. The size of that software is around 500 KBs. Although we havenâ€™t yet made that software installable with all its dependencies. So that software can only run on devices which already has java installed. Similarly the user should have Nougat android system. To use that system, the user has to perform the following steps:
<li>Install the android app.</li>
<li>Get the system end software installed</li>
<li>Connect your phone and pc using hotspot</li>
<li>Configure the IP</li>
<li>Launch the system end software</li>
<li>Use freely</li>
