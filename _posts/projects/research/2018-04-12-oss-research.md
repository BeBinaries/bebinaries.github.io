<h3>Objective</h3>
<li>To empirically Study the amount of cross-cuttingness in an open source software systems</li>
<li>To Quantify and resonate the behavior of Newcomers in a software ecosystem</li>
<li>To study various factors involved in the process of bug fixing.</li>

<br>
<h3>Work in process</h3>
We have found some really nice results which demonstrate how developers behavior affects the bug fixing process. We are taking different entropic measures to quantify the amount of cross-cuttingness. This research is an amalgam of physics and software engineering where we are using a lot of measures from physics to study the behavior pattern of developers in software development process.
