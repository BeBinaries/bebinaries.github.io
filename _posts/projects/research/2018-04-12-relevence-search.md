<h3>Rationale of the work</h3>
<li>To derive a relevance between various courses and topics leading to a job profile.</li>
<li>To draw a learning curve of a person from his preliminary academic standing to a particular job profile.</li>

<br>
Each student has the following questions in mind when studying a particular course under a certain program:
<li>Is the course I am studying relevant to my dream career?</li>
<li>How certain courses/topics can help me find a job?</li>
<li>What was the learning curve of a Person A who got a job in a Company B?</li>

This research tries to answer the aforementioned questions by investigating the relationships between topics, courses, programs and the jobs people get after completing a particular program.

The curriculum of a course is never formulated to meet a single studentâ€™s requirements. Its diverse nature is to make sure that the needs of a large number of students are met in a way where they can reap the maximum benefits out of all the courses undertaken in the stipulated period of his/her education. People get their inspiration of pursuing a particular career from various sources- the people around them, their personal interest in a field, their current academic discipline, their own social beliefs etc.

Therefore, this project aims at answering all relevant questions that a student might have in order to lead him/her to a particular job profile in the near future.
