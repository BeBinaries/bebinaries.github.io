The Desktop SMS is a simple messaging service which enables a user to send messages in bulk. I used way2sms as a messaging system. Parsed their website to automate the whole process using python code.<br>

<br>
<h3>How to use</h3>
<li>Feed in the list of numbers you wish to send message to.</li>
<li>Enter the common message you want to send to these numbers.</li>
<li>Run the python program.</li>
