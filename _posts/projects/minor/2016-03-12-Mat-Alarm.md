The Mat Alarm is Specifically designed Alarm clock. It has been experienced that
waking up is not hard its the drowsiness that doesnâ€™t let you wake up. So by any means
if you stay awake for a while and step out of your bed the the drowsiness would end and
you will not be dragged into bed. Here our objective is to make the user get off there bed
when he is supposed to wake up. To fill this purpose we are using the weight of that
person. Once you set Alarm in this device its not possible to shut the alarm off in any
conventional way like those we know as Snooze or dismiss button. Lets See the working
and Find out how useful it is.<br>
