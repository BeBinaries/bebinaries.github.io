With families getting smaller and mushrooming total number of vehicles per
head, India is now facing a new problem of â€“ lack of sufficient parking space.
Nowadays, even people having low incomes are able to own cars due to
which on any given working days nearly 40% of roads in India are just used
for parking purpose, exacerbating the situation even more woefully as cities in
India are already highly congested. The main aim of this project is to curb with
this growing menace.
On unfolding the situation more lucidly we saw that pooling of vehicles as well
as centralizing the parking system of the country could serve as a very easy-
to-use aid. To frame the entire system of pooling and parking we hereby
provide the whole database structure.
