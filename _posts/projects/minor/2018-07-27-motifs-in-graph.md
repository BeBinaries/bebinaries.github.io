<h2>Project Description</h2>
The Project was based on the research paper <strong>Motifs in Temporal Networks </strong> published in 2017 by Ashwin Paranjape, Austin R. Benson, and Jure Leskovec. The idea here was to count the number of specific pattern of communication keeping the temporal order of communication intact. Our objective was to reconstruct the algorithm presented in the paper in a way so that we can leverage the properties of a distributed system. Basically to understand the algorithm and build a parallelized version of the same.

We used a dataset which was temporal network of interactions on the stack exchange web site Stack Overflow.


<h3> Final result </h3>
We were able to reimplement the same algorithm with Hadoop but couldn't parallelized it.
